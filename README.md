Polyglot-Persistence-Explorer---MovieLens

Downloaded MovieLens dataset (100K ratings, 9K movies) and transformed it into 4 different formats for each database type
Set up 4 databases in Docker - PostgreSQL, MongoDB, ChromaDB, and Neo4j - all running simultaneously
Loaded the same data into all 4 databases with different structures optimized for each system
Ran queries on each database to demonstrate their strengths:

PostgreSQL: Analytics and aggregations
MongoDB: Flexible nested documents
ChromaDB: Semantic recommendations
Neo4j: Relationship graphs


Created Tableau dashboard with 2x2 grid showing all 4 databases side-by-side, proving polyglot persistence benefits
